# Research Question 

How can we prevent suicides?

# Data Overview

This dataset was found in kaggle and is a compiled dataset pulled from four other datasets (list in references section). This dataset records suicides numbers across over 100 countries in the world from 1985 to 2016, as well as gender and age that associate with suicides, and also the gdp per capita that associates with the country. I think this dataset is good for my research question --to find out what some potential causes to suicide are. Here is an overview look for the dataset after I cleaned. 


```{r echo=FALSE, include=FALSE,warning=FALSE}

#SETUP
library(tidyverse)
library(countrycode)
library(rworldmap)

# Load data 
master <- read.csv("master.csv")

#rename columns
names(master) <- c('country','year','sex','age','suicides_no','population','suicide_rate',
                   'country_year', 'HDI_for_year','gdp_for_year','gdp_per_capita', 'generation')
# Convert column year data type to factor
#master['year'] = as.factor(master$year)
# Convert column gdp_for_year to numeric data type
master$gdp_for_year <- gsub(",","", master$gdp_for_year)  
master$gdp_for_year <-  as.numeric(master$gdp_for_year)

# Delete years in age values
master$age <- gsub(" years", "", master$age)
master$age <- factor(master$age,
                     ordered = T,
                     levels = c("5-14", "15-24","25-34", "35-54", "55-74", "75+"))

# data selection 
# remove all missing data from HDI_for_year
# sum(is.na(master$HDI_for_year)) # NA values = 19456 > 2/3 of total observations, so not applicable

# remove this column
master <- subset(master, select = -c(HDI_for_year, suicide_rate))

master$suicide_rate <- (master$suicides_no/master$population) *100

# keep data that has 12 rows (2 sex * 6 age group) for each country_year
# master %>% 
#   group_by(country_year) %>% 
#   count() %>% 
#   filter(n != 12) # Observations from year 2016 have only 10 rows, so fliter out 2016

master <- master %>% 
  filter(year != 2016) %>% 
  select(-country_year)

# Eliminate coutries with less than 3 years of data
missing_data_year <-master %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarize(rows = n(),
            years = rows/ 12) %>% 
  arrange(years)

master <- master %>% 
  filter(!(country %in% head(missing_data_year$country,7)))

# Adding continent
master$continent <- countrycode(sourcevar = master[, "country"],
                                origin = "country.name",
                                destination = "continent")  
master$continent <- as.factor(master$continent)

master <- master %>%  
  mutate_if(is.integer, as.numeric)

```
```{r echo=FALSE}
summary(master)

```

And a quick overall view of suicides distribution across the world (Grey area indicates missing values).

# Goals and Expectations 

As you’ve learned the basic structure of the dataset, let me tell you what my goals are with the expectations of what I’m going to find with the dataset.

1.	Richer countries have a lower suicide rate
With higher gdp per capita within the country, I am expecting people would be happier and less likely to suicide. 

2.	Suicide number has decreased since 1985 
As human developing toward a higher consumption as time goes by, I am expecting people are happier now than in 1985.  

3.	Medium age males have higher suicide rate  
Males usually need to deal with higher pressures from support family, especially for males at medium age who just formed a family and maybe unstable income. Thus, the suicides rate is expected to be higher. 

With these expectations, I’m moving into my findings and insights. 

# Findings and Insights

## Richer countries have a *higher* suicide rate

Based on the figure below, it’s not hard to see that suicide rates go down as GDP per capita increase, especially for countries in Europe and Africa. However, for countries in Americas, Asia and Oceania, have a positive relationship between suicide rate and GDP per capita.  Overall, there is a slightly positive relationship, indicating richer countries have a higher suicide rate. My rationale for this finding is that a possibility of more people suffering from wealth disparities in richer countries.

## Suicide number has decreased since 1985 

The figure below indicates that suicide number has decreased significantly since 1995, which is what I’m expecting. However, a rigid raising before 1995 and had reached to the average of over 1,500,000 suicides in 1995. Moreover, suicides during 90’s and early 2000 has surpassed global average suicide number (approximately 1,310,000). I would like to investigate more on historical anecdotes during the period to find out some of possible reasons to high suicides.

## Medium age males have higher suicide rate

The bar graph below confirms my expectation that medium age men have higher overall suicides number and my assumption that men deal with more pressure than women in general. In the graph, we can see that men have higher overall suicides across all age group and have the highest suicides at age group between 35-54 years old. My further statistic test has also proved that the result –men face higher suicide probability than women— is both reliable and practical.

# Conclusion 

To conclude, I’m glad to see the suicides in 2015 has decreased to the same rate as in 1985 (see figure 2), but I think there are many economical concerns involved with the findings. Perhaps, reducing wealth disparities can help to reduce suicides number. It’s easier to say than done. One certainly can not solve or reduce the suicides immediately, I hope my findings would help even a little. 

For further analysis, it would be interesting to find out that the highest risk of suicides demographically in history.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have questions or would like to discuss the analysis further. I can also provide my complete analysis with data and code if you would like more detail.
